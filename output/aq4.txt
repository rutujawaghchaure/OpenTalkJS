Title: Investigating the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Customer Service Experience

Abstract:

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has transformed customer service interactions, offering unprecedented levels of personalization and efficiency. However, the consequences of this shift remain unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants on customer experience, focusing on both perceived satisfaction and behavioral outcomes.

Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected data from 1,000 customers who engaged with multiple AI-based customer service channels over a period of six months. Survey responses and session recordings revealed significant positive impacts on perceived satisfaction (p < .01) and knowledge retention (p < .05). Furthermore, analysis of chat logs and sentiment analysis indicated that AI-powered customer support agents were more effective at resolving issues compared to human representatives.

Our findings suggest that the adoption of AI in customer service has a net positive impact on both user experience and business outcomes. However, these benefits may be mitigated by factors such as technical difficulties, inadequate training, and insufficient contextual understanding. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between AI technologies, customer interactions, and organizational performance.
