Title: "Assessing the Impact of Urbanization on Biodiversity in City Parks: A Multidisciplinary Study"

Abstract:

Urbanization is transforming cities worldwide, leading to the development and expansion of urban parks. However, the impact of these developments on biodiversity is not well understood. This study investigates the effects of urbanization on species diversity and abundance within city parks, focusing on 20 parks across five major metropolitan areas in North America. We employed a combination of field observations, remote sensing, and spatial modeling to quantify changes in plant and animal populations over a four-year period (2018-2022). Our results show significant declines in biodiversity, with increased species extinction risk and loss of endemic species. Notably, urbanization was found to be strongly correlated with habitat degradation, fragmentation, and alteration, which are key drivers of biodiversity decline. We also identified areas where restoration efforts can maximize biodiversity benefits. These findings have important implications for urban planning, conservation, and ecosystem services in cities worldwide, highlighting the need for integrated approaches that address both human needs and environmental concerns.
