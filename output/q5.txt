In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees stand tall, their leaves aflame,
A golden glow that bears no name.

The breeze stirs soft, with rustling sound,
As petals dance, and breezes spin around.
The river flows, a winding stream,
Through hills and valleys, it gently gleams.

The mountains rise, in majestic might,
Their peaks touched high by morning light.
The wind whispers low, through valleys deep,
A soothing melody that our souls keep.

In this vast tapestry of earth and sky,
Nature's beauty catches the eye.
A kaleidoscope of colors bright,
A symphony of life, in all its might.

The sun rises high, a fiery ball,
Bringing light to all, standing tall.
The stars appear, like diamonds rare,
Twinkling and shining, with love to share.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, the world's wild release.
So let us roam, in this grand design,
And bask in beauty, that forever shines.
