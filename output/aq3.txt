**Code Documentation**
======================

This section provides information on how to write and maintain code documentation.

### Writing Code Documentation

To write code documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the purpose of the documentation**: Determine what you want to document about your code.
2. **Choose a format**: Decide on a formatting style (e.g., Markdown, XML) that suits your needs.
3. **Create an outline**: Organize your content into sections and subsections to make it easier to navigate.
4. **Write clear and concise text**: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible.
5. **Include examples and code snippets**: Use code examples to illustrate complex concepts or techniques.
6. **Use images, diagrams, and charts**: Add visual aids to help explain complex ideas.
7. **Test and review**: Ensure the documentation is accurate and up-to-date by testing it with your own code.

### Best Practices

* Keep your documentation concise and focused on the essential information.
* Avoid overloading users with too much data or technical details.
* Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to make the content easy to scan.
* Use a consistent formatting style throughout the document.
* Test your documentation against your codebase before publishing.

### Maintaining Code Documentation

To maintain code documentation:

1. **Update the documentation regularly**: Review and update the documentation as your codebase evolves.
2. **Use version control**: Store your documentation in a separate repository to ensure consistency across different versions of your code.
3. **Review and approve changes**: Have team members review and approve changes before updating the documentation.
4. **Document any changes or updates**: Clearly indicate any changes or updates made to the documentation.

### Example

Here's an example of code documentation for a simple Python script:
```markdown
# Simple Calculator Script

## Overview

This is a basic calculator script written in Python that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## Usage

To use this script, simply save it as `calculator.py` and run it using Python (e.g., `python calculator.py`).

### Code
```python
# calculate.py

def add(x, y):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    """Returns the difference of two numbers."""
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    """Returns the product of two numbers."""
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers if they are positive. Otherwise raises a ZeroDivisionError."""
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero!")
    return x / y
```
### Examples
```python
>>> add(5, 3)
8
>>> subtract(10, 4)
6
>>> multiply(7, 2)
14
>>> divide(15, 5)
3.0
```
