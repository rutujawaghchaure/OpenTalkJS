I can provide you with an example of code documentation in various formats. Here's a simple Python program that demonstrates how to write and use documentation.

**Example Program**
```python
"""
Project Name: My Project
Author Name: Your Name
Version Number: 1.0
Date Created: Today's Date
Description:
    This is a simple calculator program.
"""

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Calculator(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for calculators.

    Attributes:
        number1 (float): The first operand of the operator.
        number2 (float): The second operand of the operator.
        operation (str): The mathematical operation to perform.
    """

    def __init__(self, number1, number2, operation):
        """
        Initializes a Calculator object.

        Args:
            number1 (float): The first operand of the operator.
            number2 (float): The second operand of the operator.
            operation (str): The mathematical operation to perform.
        """
        self.number1 = number1
        self.number2 = number2
        self.operation = operation

    @abstractmethod
    def calculate(self):
        """
        Calculates the result of the operation.

        Returns:
            float: The calculated result.
        """
        pass


class Addition(Calculator):
    """
    Class representing an addition calculator.
    """

    def calculate(self):
        """
        Calculates the sum of two numbers.

        Returns:
            float: The calculated sum.
        """
        return self.number1 + self.number2


class Subtraction(Calculator):
    """
    Class representing a subtraction calculator.
    """

    def calculate(self):
        """
        Calculates the difference between two numbers.

        Returns:
            float: The calculated difference.
        """
        return self.number1 - self.number2


# Example usage:

calculator = Addition()
result = calculator.calculate()

print(f"The result of {calculator.operation}({calculator.number1}, {calculator.number2}) is {result}")

calculator = Subtraction()
result = calculator.calculate()

print(f"The result of {calculator.operation}({calculator.number1}, {calculator.number2}) is {result}")
```

**How to Use the Documentation**

To use the documentation, simply copy and paste it into your code editor or IDE. You can also print out the documentation as a formatted text string.

For example, if you are using Jupyter Notebook:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from IPython.display import display

# Define the documentation
document = """
Project Name: My Project
Author Name: Your Name
Version Number: 1.0
Date Created: Today's Date
Description:
    This is a simple calculator program.
"""

display(document)
```

Alternatively, you can use Markdown formatting to write and format your own documentation:

**Example Markdown Documentation**
```markdown
# Calculator Program

This program provides a basic implementation of a calculator in Python.

## Overview

The `Calculator` class represents a mathematical operation, such as addition or subtraction. The `Addition` and `Subtraction` classes are subclasses that implement the specific calculations for these operations.

## Usage

To use this program, create an instance of the desired calculator class, passing in the operands and operation name as arguments. You can then call the `calculate()` method to perform the calculation.

## Example Usage

```python
# Create instances of Calculator and Addition/Subtraction classes
calculator = Calculator(2, 3, "+")
result_addition = calculator.calculate()
print(f"The result of {calculator.operation}(2, 3) is {result_addition}")

calculator = Calculator(5, 3, "-")
result_subtraction = calculator.calculate()
print(f"The result of {calculator.operation}(5, 3) is {result_subtraction}")
```
