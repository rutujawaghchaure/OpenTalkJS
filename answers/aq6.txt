Title: Investigating the Impact of Digital Literacy on Career Development in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Abstract:

In today's rapidly evolving job market, career development is becoming increasingly dependent on digital literacy skills. Despite growing awareness about the importance of these skills, there is a lack of empirical research examining their impact on employment outcomes. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between digital literacy and career advancement in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 500 professionals with expertise in AI and digital literacy, as well as interviews with 20 industry leaders who have successfully transitioned into roles requiring advanced AI skills. Results showed that individuals with higher levels of digital literacy demonstrated improved career advancement prospects, increased job satisfaction, and enhanced employability in the face of emerging technological changes. Conversely, low levels of digital literacy were associated with decreased career progression and lower self-efficacy. The study's findings have important implications for education systems, workplace training programs, and organizations seeking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI-driven innovation.
