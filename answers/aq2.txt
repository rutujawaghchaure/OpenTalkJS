Here's a short story plot idea:
Title: The Memory Weaver

Protagonist Emilia is a young, reclusive woman who has always been plagued by vivid and disturbing memories. She lives in a remote village on the outskirts of a vast, mysterious forest. One day, while out collecting herbs for her family's medicine garden, Emilia stumbles upon an ancient, worn-out loom hidden behind a waterfall.

Intrigued, she decides to use the loom to weave a new fabric that will help her control and manipulate her memories. As she begins to sew, she discovers that each thread represents a specific memory from her past. The more she weaves, the stronger the threads become, and Emilia becomes increasingly obsessed with unraveling the secrets of her family's cursed history.

As Emilia delves deeper into her heritage, she starts to experience strange visions and flashbacks that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. She begins to question her own sanity as she realizes that her memories may not be entirely her own.

Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger arrives in the village, seeking shelter from a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the forest. His true intentions remain unknown, but Emilia senses an eerie connection to the loom and its ancient powers. As their paths converge, Emilia must decide whether to trust this stranger or remain wary of his secrets.

Throughout her journey, Emilia will confront the darker aspects of her own past, uncover hidden truths about her family's past, and face the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. Will she be able to unravel the mystery of her loom and her memories, or will the threads of her past forever entangle her?
